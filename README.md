YOU MUST RETRIEVE API KEYS FOR MOVIEDB site and GRACENOTE sites to test by registering on their sites (listed below)!! 

This app allows users to select movies to watch staying in (available for rental) or going out to a local theatre. It utilizes to APIs, the MovieDB API (which has been removed and can be created on the MovieDB.com site:https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and the GraceNote API (which has also been removed and can be created on the GraceNote site:http://developer.tmsapi.com/Getting_Started). When searching for movies staying in, the movies are saved locally using a ContentProvider to be used for the widget. The user can choose to rent the movie on Amazon when selecting a movie for staying in or through the widget when landing on the details page. When searching for movies in a local theatre, the app uses Google Play Services to obtain the users current location or their zipcode. The app also displays ads on the Search page using AdMob by Google (it shows test ads). The user can choose a theatre to open a fandango link to buy tickets (link comes from GraceNote api) when landing on the details page.  The widget allows the user to quickly select a random movie through the app.  Once selected, the app will open and show the details of the random movie selected. It will also allow the user to rent the movie on Amazon.
